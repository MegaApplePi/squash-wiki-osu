# squash-wiki-osu

> RIP August 2019 - August 2019; A thing created to understand GitHub's API/OAuth apps... or APIs in general. Immediately died after completion.

A thing to squash commits using GitHub's API. Has some side-effects:

- A pull request is created to do the actual squashing.
- A temporary master reference(branch) from upstream is created to be the "base branch" for squash merging.
