# squash-wiki-osu

> RIP August 2019 - August 2019; A thing created to learn about the GitHub's API/OAuth apps. Immediately died after completion.

A thing to squash commits using GitHub's API. Has some side-effects:

- A pull request is required to do the actual squashing.
- A temporary master reference from upstream is created to be the "base branch" for merging. (May not actually be needed?)
